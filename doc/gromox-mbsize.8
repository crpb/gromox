.SH Name
gromox\-mbsize \(em Mailbox size analysis
.SH Synopsis
\fBgromox\-mbsize\fP \fIdirectory\fP
.SH Description
Shows a detailed view of how a mailbox size translates to on-disk usage.
Explanation of the columns/rows follows.
.PP
Apparent size: This is the exact size of the object, or simply the sum
of sizes of objects.
.PP
On FS: This is the space that is used on the filesystem, and is subject
to fs block sizes. Details about this behavior may be found on
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(data_storage)>. As a result,
the on-disk size may be larger than the apparent size.
.PP
RFC5322/Mbox: For the sake of IMAP, RFC5322 copies of messages and some
metadata is retained.
.PP
RFC5322 Received: Applies to messages received via delivery(8gx).
.PP
RFC5322 Sent: Applies to any other message.
.PP
Body analysis: A set of 4 MAPI properties that usually get stored as files on
disk rather than inside the sqlite database: PR_BODY, PR_HTML,
PR_RTF_COMPRESSED and PR_INTERNET_TRANSPORT_HEADERS. In gromox\-mbsize, these
are considered "body".
.PP
Attachment analysis: What it says. Not all MIME parts are or stay an
attachment; for example, calendar items/meeting requests are usually converted
to MAPI objects.
.PP
Missing items/Apparent: The number of MAPI properties/attachments which have a
dangling reference into the filesystem.
.PP
Missing items/FS: The on-disk number of files that seem to be absent. This
number can be lower than Apparent due to internal data deduplication that is
transparent to MAPI/exmdb clients.
.PP
Informational content: The logical amount of data that is represented by those
four MAPI properties / by MAPI attachments.
.PP
After deduplication: The logical amount of unique bodies/attachments.
.PP
Dedup ratio/gains: For the "body" group, there are usually little gains to be
observed in practice; bodies are just very unique. Messages like "test" are
ironically the ones that benefit. Attachments dedup a little better, owing to
many people sending/receiving redundant information, such as company logos.
.PP
After compression: Besides deduplication, Gromox can also compress before data
goes to disk. This is also the final form and so there is an apparent and an
on-disk value. The on-disk value may be higher due to aforementioned filesystem
block sizing.
.PP
File compress ratio/gains: The earnings going from Dedup to Compressed.
.PP
IFC compress ratio/gains: The earnings going from Informational Content to
Compressed.
.PP
MAPI reported sizes: The PR_MESSAGE_SIZE property of a store, folder, message,
and the PR_ATTACH_SIZE property of an attachment, all give a close
approximation to the amount of data needed to transfer the object(s) over a
MAPI connection.
.PP
NTS deviation: how much the Network Transfer Size is off from the on-disk size.
.PP
Provisioning factor: The ratio between on-disk usage and the logical mailbox
size reported inside MUAs.
