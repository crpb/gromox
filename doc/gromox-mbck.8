.TH gromox\-mbck 8 "" "Gromox" "Gromox admin reference"
.SH Name
\fBgromox\-mbck\fP \(em Mailbox check and repair utility
.SH Synopsis
\fBgromox\-mbck\fP [\fB\-p\fP] x.sqlite
.SH Description
mbck can be used to check one or more mailboxes for problems, and optionally
repairing them.
.PP
It is technically safe to run gromox\-mbck while gromox\-http has a mailbox
open, provided Gromox is version >= 2.30. HOWEVER, gromox\-http (still as of
Gromox 2.36) does not anticipate databases being write-locked by another
process, and signals an operational error to the caller. For example, mail
cannot be delivered to the mailbox while mbck is running in repair/write mode.
.SH Options
.TP
\fB\-p\fP
